# Colinear Points

Recognizing patters in data is an important problem in computer science, especially
in computer vision which powers everything from your phone's facial recognition
and fingerprint scanner to self-driving cars and airplane guidance systems. In this
lab, you will attempt to solve a problem closely reltated to computer vision: identifying
colinear points.

## Lines in the plane
We say that a group of _n_ points are _colinear_
